# simple-calculator
A simple calculator using Html, CSS and Js.
I created this project to practice what I learned and learn new things. 
I took the project from my course and implemented some improvements and new features, in addition to improving the look. 
I'm starting my studies in Javascript so my code may present incoherence or inconsistencies.
